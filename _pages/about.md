Hi, I'm a fourth year PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Yorie Nakahira](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/nakahira-yorie.html). Prior to joining CMU, I obtained my Bachelor degree at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by Prof. [Gao Huang](https://www.gaohuang.net/) and Prof. [Yilin Mo](https://yilinmo.github.io/). 

My reseach interests include safety-critical control, physics-informed learning, stochastic systems and robotics.
